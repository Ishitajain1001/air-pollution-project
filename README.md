Created 3 different models to predict the annual average PM2.5 concentration at a monitor and discovered which of the models performed best.

Conducted a linear regression model, k-nn model, and a random forest model using relevant predictors such as CMAQ, aod, log_dist_to_prisec, log_nei_2008_pm25_sum_10000, nohs.

Found that the random forest model performed the best.
